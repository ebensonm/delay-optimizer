# delay-optimizer
## Adds time delays to an optimizer
This implements time-delayed optimizer tests on rastrigin and ackley functions. It can be easily modified to work with other cost functions as well though. The optimizer uses python and numpy to compute values and derivatives so function should be compatible with those.
